## semantic_segmentation_satellite_image

### Basic Information:
In this project, I develop machine learning models to detect geological features from Landsat 8 images. In this project, I aim to develop machine learning models that can detect different geologic features especially faults from satellite images. I have used a deep neural network and random forest algorithms to identify features from Landsat 8 images. The model is powerful that it can even detect recently developed river bar, and sharp fault bends. I am still working on the model to make it better predictor for geoscientists.

### Notebook files/folder :
<li> image_classification.ipynb : Image processing and Model building 
<li> shape_files : Shape files of the features (river, elevated region, river bar, low land)

### Codes and libraries

This project requires Python 3+. I have Used python 3.6.4. The following Python libraries are also required:

<li> NumPy - Numerical tool
<li> Pandas - Dataframe 
<li> matplotlib - Plotting library
<li> scikit-learn - Classical machine leaning library
<li> Keras - Deep learning library
<li> Gdal - GIS and remote sensing data processing tool

### Datasets 
Landsat Images can be downloaded from USGS earth explorer
